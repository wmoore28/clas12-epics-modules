* Version 2.0.1 (August 7th, 2015)
- Fixed a bug in the S7nodavePortDriverReadOptimizer class that could cause a
  segmentation fault due to the dereference of an iterator that pointed to the
  end of a list.
- Fixed a bug in the definition of the s7nodaveConfigureIsoTcpPort iocsh
  command that would allow the command to be called with too few arguments. This
  bug was introduced with the 2.0.0 release.
- Allow the user to locally override paths and setting without modifying RELEASE
  or CONFIG_SITE by including a RELEASE.local and CONFIG_SITE.local if present.

* Version 2.0.0 (February 8th, 2015):
- Changed the initialization code so that a rack and slot number for the PLC can
  be specified.
- Changed the address parsing code so that bit addresses in data blocks are
  correctly written as DB###.DBX##.#. Before, they had to be written as
  DB###.DB##.# (no X).

* Version 1.0.3 (April 24th, 2014)
- Fixed a bug in the device support routine for the stringout record, where a
  cast to a wrong structure type resulted in the record address not being read
  correctly. Thanks go to Marko Volk (Cosylab) for reporting this bug and
  submitting a patch.
- Fixed a bug in the parsing routine for PLC addresses, that caused timer and
  counter addresses with a single digit number to be rejected. Thanks go to
  Marko Volk (Cosylab) for reporting this bug.
- Added support for specifying a poll-group for analog input records (this was
  accidentally deactivated for this record type).
- Fixed a bug that caused the PLC connection to stay locked, if the
  initialization of an output record failed.
- Fixed a bug in libnodave that caused problems when trying to write to counter
  or timer addresses.
- Fixed a bug in the trace functions of the driver, which would check the
  trace-IO mask where the trace mask would have been appropriate.
- Fixed a bug in the stringin and stringout record, that cause only the first
  five bytes to be transmitted.

* Version 1.0.2 (January 21st, 2013)
- Fixed a bug that caused a non-zero value to be returned for a boolean that was
  read from the first bit of an address, when this bit was zero but other bits
  at the address were non-zero.

* Version 1.0.1 (December 17th, 2012)
- Fixed a bug that caused an IOC crash on initialization, when an ao record was
  used with a float-type in the PLC. This also fixed a bug that did not
  correctly deactivate conversion when using an ai record with a float-type in
  the PLC.
- Removed unused variables that caused compiler warnings.

* Version 1.0.0 (January 28th, 2012)
- First release of s7nodave.
